# [Exploit the Unknown Gradually: One-Shot Video-Based Person Re-Identification by Stepwise Learning](https://yu-wu.net/pdf/CVPR2018_Exploit-Unknown-Gradually.pdf)

Pytorch implementation for the [paper](https://yu-wu.net/pdf/CVPR2018_Exploit-Unknown-Gradually.pdf) based on [Open-ReID](https://github.com/Cysu/open-reid)

## Preparation
### Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch (version >= 0.2.0)
- h5py, scikit-learn, metric-learn, tqdm

### Download datasets 
We will release the datasets soon.



## Train

```shell
python3 run.py --arch avg_pool --dataset mars_video --logs_dir logs/mars_EF_10/ --EF 10 --mode Dissimilarity --max_frames 900
```
Please set the `max_frames` smaller if your GPU memory is less than 11G.

It takes about 25 hours on my machine with a GTX1080Ti to finish all the iterations for EUG with EF=10%.

## Performances

The performances varies according to random splits for initial labeled data. To reproduce the performances in our paper, please use the one-shot split at `./examples/oneshot_mars_used_in_paper.pickle` for MARS and `./examples/oneshot_dukeMTMC_VideoReID_used_in_paper.pickle` for DukeMTMC-VideoReID.
